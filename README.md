### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my area on Github. 

My name is Daron Jones, however you may find me online by the name Wuntenn (pronounced👂🏾 "one-ten"). One-ten or The First of October in the UK is my birthdate and coicidentally Nigerian Independence Day! 

There isn't much here to show by the way of personal code samples. I guess I'm an introvert coder (most of my projects are private! 😅).

There are quite a few projects listed publicly here that are tests done for interview purposes. These should be useful to give an indidation of the way that I code. There are samples mostly in JavaScript based tech, however I am able to
code in C++ and similar languages so you may see other languages around here also. You can find my CV over at my website linked below.

In you came here looking for projects, I feature a number of them on my LinkedIn account under the projects section:
